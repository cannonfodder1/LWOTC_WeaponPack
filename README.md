# X2LongWarOfTheChosen
X2LongWarOfTheChosen was a previous modding project that collapsed in mid 2018. When their GitHub was made public, I downloaded the WeaponPack and began messing around with it, creating new 3D models from existing weapons. The majority of the code here is not mine, but the LW_SAW.upk and LW_DMR.upk content files contain my original weapon models with working animations and such.

This project is currently on the backburner, but I may return to it at some point.
